<h1><FONT COLOR="RED">its lovely to introduce my favourite friends</h1></FONT>
<h2>1.KOSHIN</h2>
<p>KOSHIN IS ONE OF MY MOST FAV. BUDDY I HAVE EVER GOT HE IS NOW LIKE A BROTHER FROM ANOTHER MOTHER<br>
 HE IS AN INTROVERTED PERSON WITH BOTH SHY AND AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOUR ....<br>
 WITH THIS I WOULD LIKE TO WRITE MORE QUOTES:<br>
Friendship is the hardest thing in the world to explain. <br>
It's not something you learn in school. <br>
But if you haven't learned the meaning of friendship, <br>
you really haven't learned anything<br>
</p>
<H2>2.NAVYAM</H2>
<p>NAVYAM IS ALSO ONE OF THE MOST NAUGHTORIOUS FRIEND ...<br>
    BUT HE IS ALSO SO SPECIAL TO ME .... SORRY BUT I CANT WRITE MORE BECAUSE I AM PRACTISING CODE <br>
    BUT I HAVE ALSO A QUOTE;<br>
    Hence (if you will not misunderstand me) the exquisite arbitrariness and irresponsibility of this love<br> 
    I have no duty to be anyone's Friend and no man in the world has a duty to be mine. No claims, no shadow of necessity.<br>
     Friendship is unnecessary, like philosophy, like art, like the universe itself (for God did not need to create).<br>
     It has no survival value; rather it is one of those things which give value to survival.<br>
</p>
<H2>3.HRISHEEKESH</H2>
<P>MY OLD AND GOLD FRIEND U HAVE ALREADY BEEN A MEMORY IN MY HEART I HOPE U WILL AGAIN COME TO MY NEW school<br>
    WAITING FOR U IN MY NEW SCHOOL<br>
    .. HERE IS ALSO ONE MORE QUOTE FOR U:<br>
    One friend with whom you have a lot in common is better than three with whom you struggle to find things to talk about.<br>
     We never needed best friend gear because I guess with real friends you don't have to make it official. It just is..<br>
</P>

     ONE QUOTE FOR U:A good friend is a connection to life â€” a tie to the past,<br>
      a road to the future, the key to sanity in a totally insane world.<br>
</P>
